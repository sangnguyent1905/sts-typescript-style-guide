## Naming style

- Names should be two things: `clear` (know what it refers to) and `precise` (know what it does not refer to);

- Do not use `_` for `private` properties or methods.

- Do not use prefix `I` for interfaces

- Do not mark interfaces specially (IMyInterface or MyFooInterface).

- Suffixing Observables with `$`
